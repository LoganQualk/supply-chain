            <p>
                These supply chain issues do not just affect technology buffs, they affect everyone.  
                From those of us that have smart homes to those of us that use flip phones, we all experience these hardships with the supply chain.  
                Issues with it have also affected other facets of society.  
                There have been increases in delivery time for almost all products and an increase in cost. 
            </p>
            <p>
                All products have greatly reduced in their availability.  
                Toiler paper, technology, and even cute sweaters and hats for your pet dogs (y'know because tis the holiday season and they deserve to be festive too).  
                These products have all felt the shift in the supply chain as they have increased in not only price but also scarcity.
