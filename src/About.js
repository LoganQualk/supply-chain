                Hello! My name is Logan Qualkenbush and I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and Information and Library Science with a minor in Cognitive Science.  
                As someone with their main hobby being PC gaming, I have greatly felt the effects of the supply chain first hand.  
                Last year in December of 2020, I decided it was time to replace my 2012 desktop (out-dated, I know!) and build a new custom one.  
                As of today, December 7th, 2021, I still have not been able to find a new graphics card :( and am still on the market for one.  
                My main hobbies include PC games (CS:GO, Valorant, and Teamfight Tactics), golf (I'm awful and Simon is helping me to get better), and music with my recent obsession being Mac Miller.  
                Follow me on Instagram @Logan_Qualkenbush!
            </p>
